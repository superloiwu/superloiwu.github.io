#About the Project

I am working on a project called PPSDK. PPSDK is a SDK for iOS Game developers. The purpose of PPSDK is to export capabilities of the payment system and platform operation to the content providers.

#About [Software Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) 

A software development kit is a set of software development tools. SDK allows the creation of applications for certain development platform. To create certain applications you have to download certain SDK.

#Experience gaining from PPSDK Project

- You are not only a coder, but also an architect. You must consider about the architecture, not only the functions implementation.
- API design is very important, you should follow certain principles. A great naming convention of API is worth thousand of words.
- There are two categories of API, synchronous to asynchronous. Synchronous API sometimes is better than asynchronous ones.
- Multithreading. Take care of main thread and schedule child threads carefully.
- Be careful about the 3rd SDK. Add an additional wrap for 3rd SDK's error codes. You should avoid exposure the 3rd platform to developer who is using your SDK.
- Carefully plan the version, and you'd better use digit version number.
